Numericall solving the ODE y' = k - my where k and m are abibrary constants. y'=F(y), thus this DE is autonomous
Initial value: y(0) = y_0 
Since y_n = y_{n-1} + F(y_{n-1})*dx,
    y_n = y_{n-1} + (k-my_{n-1})*dx and since the DE is autonomous changing x will t be necessary in the numerical solution. 
    dy = (k-my_{n-1})*dx
